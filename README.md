# Students-Performance-Analysis
There is an important key objective in higher education is to provide quality education to their students and minimize the dropout rate. It is possible to accomplished by predicting students' results through Educational Data Mining (EDM). This study objective is to evaluate the performance of students who belong to following categories like excellent, good, average, poor and probation and compare results between excellent, poor and provision students through some effective features. We analyze educational data using different EDM models which can check the accuracy of the result. Finally recommend the learners to improve their performances. In this work, we have collected 675 undergraduate students’ records from the departments of Computer Science and Engineering in IUBAT-International University of Business Agriculture and Technology. We compared the performance of six Data Mining  methods for academic achievement. The methods are, K-Nearest Neighbor, Decision Tree, Gaussian Naïve Bayes, Support Vector Machine, Logistic Regression, and Random Forest.
